# NITJ_Placement_Portal
This is Placement Portal where the student, the admin & the TPO officials will have their individual dashboards.
# Why this portal?
Traditionally, the students have to fill same information again and again during their on campus placement.
So, using this idea, we want to facilitate the students such that they only have to fill up their ceredentials only once.
# Different Entities & their working
Whenever a new company comes to the campus they just have to click on APPLY and if they meet the required reuirements then successfully applied for the company.
For TPO officials, they will update the different hiring drives on-going in the campus and can easily check from the dashboard how many students have applied for the process, can download their resumes.
Admin will be the supreme entity, which will be having the right to approve and disapprove the students & officials after going through their ceredentials.
